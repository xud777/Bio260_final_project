  "body": "Markdown image syntax looks a lot like the syntax for links; it is essentially the same syntax preceded by an exclamation point (!). For example, if you want to link to an image at https://github.com/unicorn.png with the alternate text My Unicorn, you would write ![My Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn.png).\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\nAs one of our most used apps, Yelp provides us with useful information on restaurants' hours, food type, and price range. More importantly, we are able to instantly compare restaurants through user reviews that are conveniently displayed in a 5 star scale. In this project, we aim to use the skills we learned throughout the course to \r\n* Obtain Yelp user review dataset by web scrapping\r\n* Cleaning up the data through wrangling \r\n* Visualize the data\r\n* Create a statistical model using data we have collected\r\n* Test the model we built with new data\r\n* Finally, communicate the results through website and webcast\r\n\r\n### Obtaining Data: Web Scrapping and Wrangling\r\nWe scrapped data from 1000 restaurants in Boston using the Google Chrome extension called [WebScraper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn?hl=en). \r\n\r\nThe raw output from the WebScrapper was quite messy and required extensive wrangling to obtain a final data set. \r\n\r\n### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\n\r\nWe explored  \r\n\r\n### Geographic Distribution of Yelp Ratings\r\n\r\n### Modeling Yelp Review Ratings with Regression\r\n\r\n### Testing Regression Model\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
